# Development-and-Detection-of-Keyloggers-for-Windows-OS
Introduction :-
This project involves both the development of a keylogger for the Windows operating system and the creation of detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate keylogger activities. The implementation phase will focus on creating a keylogger application capable of capturing keystrokes on a Windows system, utilizing various techniques such as hooking into the keyboard input events. The detection phase will involve researching and implementing methods to identify keylogger behavior, including signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and monitoring system processes for suspicious activity.
Domain of the Project :-
Cybersecurity - Keylogging
Expected Outcome :-
The expected outcome of this project includes:
1.	Development of a functional keylogger application for the Windows operating system.
2.	Implementation of effective detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate keylogger activities.
3.	Detailed documentation, including a project report outlining the implementation process, detection methodologies, and evaluation results.
Suggested Tools/Techniques to be Used :-
•	Programming Languages: C++, Python
•	System Monitoring Tools: Process Explorer, Sysinternals Suite
•	Detection Techniques: Signature-based detection, Heuristic analysis
•	Testing: Antivirus software for testing detection capabilities

Conclusion :- 
This project offers a comprehensive exploration of both offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity related to keyloggers. Interns will gain hands-on experience in software development, system monitoring, and cybersecurity techniques, culminating in a detailed understanding of keylogger threats and protection strategies
